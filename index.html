<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
My version of Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. 
I use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>USING</strong> &mdash; Technologies that I worked in the past and I love to work with. Either my day to day job or my hobby projects are related with them.</li>
<li><strong>WILL TRY</strong> &mdash; Technologies that I want to try and reading about currently. Eventually, they will end-up in USING section.</li>
<li><strong>INTEREST</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for me; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that I think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
</ul>
